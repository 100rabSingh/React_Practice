Why Higher Order Component?
 => To share the common functionality between the Components without repeating the code.

What is HOC?
=> A Pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new component.
    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent( original Component )

    ex: const IronMan = withSuit( Tony Stark )
