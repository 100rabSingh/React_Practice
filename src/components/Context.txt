Context is a API.
=> Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Steps to Implement Context:
    1) Create the Context
    2)Provide a Context Value
    3) Consume the Context Value in necessary Components

# You can set a default Value to your context, and default value is set while creating the context - it is passed as an argument to 
  createContext method

# ContextType Property : Easier than Consumer Component
    But there are 2 Limitations:
        1) It Only works with Class Components
        2) You can Only Subscribe to a single Context using Context Type
